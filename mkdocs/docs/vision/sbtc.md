# Paying Transaction fees in BTC and sBTC

There are discussion how users can pay transaction fees in BTC and sBTC. See for example [this forum post](https://forum.stacks.org/t/enabling-sbtc-as-a-gas-asset-on-stacks/15823).

Currently, there is no clear plan how this will be implemented. There does not yet exist a SIP for the idea to pay transaction fees in BTC or sBTC.
